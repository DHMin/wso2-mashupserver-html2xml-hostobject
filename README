============================================================

 You don't have to hassle with WebHarvest XML syntax anymore.
 Just drop the output jar of this project in WSO2_MS_HOME/repository/components/dropins,
restart your mashup server, and you are ready to go.

 * Usage:
 
var html2xml = new Html2Xml(); 
var xml = html2xml.transform("<html><body><b>Hello World!</b><b>Test</b></body></html>"); 
var something = xml.body.b[0].toString(); // EcmaScript 4 XML 
system.log(something); 
------------------------------------------------------------
It will print out "Hello World!".

 * Build:
 - Don't use m2eclipse to build. It won't build due to broken dependencies.
(WSO2 has several serious problems with their POMs)
 - Just use command line Maven which will generate the output even with the POM errors.

 * Note:
 - The most outer HTML tag is represented by the variable itself. Ex: xml.html.body (X), xml.body (O).
 - Subtract 1 for the index of XPath element array. Ex: XPath for "Test" /html/body/b[2], 
 but with Html2Xml, xml.body.body[1].toString().
